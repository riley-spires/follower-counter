# Follower Count for Raspberry Pi

## Hardware Setup

1. Power to Matrix
    - Connect the **5V** and **GND** wires from your external power supply directly
      to the **5V** and **GND** inputs on your LED matrix
2. Common Ground
    - Connect the **GND** from external power supply to a **GND** pin on the Raspberry Pi
3. Data Signal
    - Connect a GPIO pin from the Pi to the data input of the level shifter, and then
      the output of the shifter to the **Data In (DIN)** pin on the matrix. **GPIO 10 (SPI MOSI)**
      is tthe recommended pin for the luma library
